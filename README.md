           7.1.2  Remove the CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV environment variable, if i have it

           7.1.3  Add a new key DEBUG with a value of ‘1’

           7.1.4  Add a new key ALLOWED_HOST with the value of my development environment URL, wrapped in quotes

            - Ensure I remove the https:// from the beginning, and the trailing slash / from the end of the development environment URL.

           7.1.5  Add a new key CLIENT_ORIGIN with the value of my development environment URL, wrapped in quotes

            - This string should include the https:// at the beginning, but the trailing slash / should be removed.

           7.1.6  Ensure I have a key for DATABASE_URL set to the value of my ElephantSQL database URL

           7.1.7  Ensure I have a key for CLOUDINARY_URL set to the value of your Cloudinary URL

       7.2  Updating settings.py

           7.2.1  Set DEBUG to the value of the DEBUG environment variable and update ALLOWED_HOSTS to include

                  the ALLOWED_HOST environment variable added to your env.py file

           7.2.2  In my settings.py file remove the line containing the import re

           7.2.3  Remove all the CORS code, leaving only the CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS list

- Open two terminals, side by side

       8.1  First should be in the root directory where the Django API will run. From here, type the command to run the Django API

            python3 manage.py runserver

![image](https://github.com/Tamirucode/react-todoitem/assets/116649197/fd0a9f61-c9fd-462d-aaeb-0b04a60a019b)

       8.2  Second should be in the frontend directory. To enter that directory from the root, type the following command

            cd frontend

            Then run the React server with the following command:

            npm start

       8.3  I open port 3000 or 8000 to see my React app and checked that the functionality all works

       8.4  Git add,  git commit  and git push changes sofar

## Deployment of both applications

   1. Setting up WhiteNoise for static files: In the terminal

       1.1  Ensure my terminal location is in the root directory, then install whitenoise with the following command

            pip3 install whitenoise==6.4.0

       1.2  Add this dependency to my requirements.txt file with the following command

           pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

       1.3  Create a new empty folder called staticfiles in the root directly with the following command

           mkdir staticfiles

   2. Setting.py

        2.1  In the INSTALLED_APPS list, ensure that the ‘cloudinary_storage’ app name is below ‘django.contrib.staticfiles’. 
        
            This ensures that Cloudinary will not attempt to intervene with staticfiles, and 
            
            allows whitenoise to become the primary package responsible for static files

        2.2  In the MIDDLEWARE list, add WhiteNoise below the SecurityMiddleware and above the SessionMiddleware

           'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware', 

        2.3  In the TEMPLATES list at the DIRS key, add the following code to the DIRS list, to tell Django and 
        
             WhiteNoise where to look for Reacts index.html file in deployment os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles', 'build')

        2.4  In the static files section, add the STATIC_ROOT and WHITENOISE_ROOT variables and values to tell Django and WhiteNoise
         
             where to look for the admin static files and Reacts static files during deployment

   3. In the urls.py file of my Django Rest Framework application:

             3.1  Remove the root_route view from the .views imports

             3.2  Import the TemplateView from the generic Django views from django.views.generic import TemplateView

             3.3  In the url_patterns list, remove the root_route code and replace it with the TemplateView pointing to the index.html file

                 path('', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='index.html')),

             3.4  At the bottom of the file, add the 404 handler to allow React to handle 404 errors

                 handler404 = TemplateView.as_view(template_name='index.html')

             3.5  Add api/ to the beginning of all the API URLs, excluding the path for the home page and admin panel

)

   4.  In axiosDefault.js:

             4.1  Now that we have changed the base path for the API route, we need to prepend all API requests in our react application with /api. 
               
                  Open the axiosDefaults.js file, comment back in the axios.defaults.baseURL and set it to "/api"
     
   5.  Git add,  git commit  and git push changes sofar

   6.  Compiling the static files

             6.1  Collect the admin and DRF staticfiles to the empty staticfiles directory I created earlier, with the following command in the terminal

                    python3 manage.py collectstatic

             6.2  Next, we will compile the React application and move its files to the staticfiles folder. In another terminal, cd into the frontend directory

                    cd frontend

             6.3  Then run the command to compile and move the React files

                    npm run build && mv build ../staticfiles/.

                     NB:-you will need to re-run this command any time you want to deploy changes to the static files in your project, including the React code. 
                     
                     To do this, you need to delete the existing build folder and rebuild it.

                     This command will delete the old folder and replace it with the new one: npm run build && rm -rf ../staticfiles/build && mv build ../staticfiles/.

              6.4  Now your staticfiles folder should be filled with all the static files needed for deployment

   7. Adding a runtime.txt file

              7.1  In the root directory of your project, create a new file named runtime.txt

              7.2  Inside the runtime.txt, add the following line:

                   python-3.9.16

   8. Testing the Build

              8.1  Ensure all running servers are terminated. In any running terminals press Ctrl + C

              8.2  In my env.py file, ensure that both the DEBUG and DEV environment variables are commented out

              8.3  Run the Django server, in the terminal type

                   python3 manage.py runserver

              8.4  open the preview on port 8000 to check that your application is running, it works

              8.5  Git add,  git commit  and git push changes sofar

   9. Preparing my existing Heroku app for deployment

              9.1  Log into my Heroku account and access the dashboard for my DRF application

              9.2  Go to Settings and open the Config Vars

              9.3  Add ALLOWED_HOST key, set to the URL of my combined project,

               - I removed the https:// from the beginning, and the trailing slash / from the end URL.

              9.4  Add CLIENT_ORIGIN key, set to the URL of my combined project,

               - This string should include the https:// at the beginning, but the trailing slash / should be removed.

              9.5  Git add, git commit  and git push changes sofar

              9.6  Select the “Deploy” tab in the dashboard

              9.7  Scroll down to the bottom and then select “Deploy Branch”

              9.8  Wait for my build to complete (I can click “view build log” to watch the process in a larger window)

              9.9  When you see the message “deployed to Heroku” in the build log, click the “open app” button at the top of the page.
